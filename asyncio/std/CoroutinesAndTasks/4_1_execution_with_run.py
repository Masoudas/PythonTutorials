"""
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)

Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop, finalizing asynchronous generators, and closing the threadpool.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

"""
import asyncio


async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
